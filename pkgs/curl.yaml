# optionally build with ca-bundle package as a parameter if you want to
# trust hashstack's ca-bundle and want to squash the errors/warnings about
# not being able to verify ssl connections and your system does not come
# with an appropriate certificate bundle you can use or trust.

# curl is built with openssl and does not automatically make use of
# CRL's to check for revoked certificates. Users can manually tell curl
# to use a CRL file when making https requests with the --crlfile command
# option. Please refer to the curl man page and also http://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-compared.html
# and http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
